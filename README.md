# Inner Order and Civilizational Failure

This repository documents a structural perspective on a growing global crisis
commonly framed as “mental health”.

It proposes that the deeper issue is not psychological pathology,
but the large-scale collapse of inner order — the internal coherence
that allows human beings to remain stable under change.

This repository is not a belief system, ideology, or treatment model.
It is a conceptual and structural framework intended for long-term reference.

## Scope

- Definition of inner order
- Distinction between inner order and mental health
- Civilizational implications of inner order collapse

## What This Is Not

- Not religious doctrine
- Not political ideology
- Not self-help content
- Not clinical guidance

The materials here are provided for conceptual clarity and future reference.

Inner order operates beneath circumstance.
External structures may support coherence, but cannot replace it.

Inner order operates beneath circumstance and defines system feasibility.
