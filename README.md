# Inner Order and Civilizational Failure

This repository documents a structural perspective on a growing global crisis
commonly framed as “mental health”.

It proposes that the deeper issue is not psychological pathology,
but the large-scale collapse of inner order — the internal coherence
that allows human beings to remain stable under change.

This repository is not a belief system, ideology, or treatment model.
It is a conceptual and structural framework intended for long-term reference.

## Scope

- Civilizational implications of inner order collapse

## What This Is Not

The materials here are provided for conceptual clarity and future reference.
