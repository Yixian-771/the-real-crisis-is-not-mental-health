Inner Order Defines the Feasibility Limits of Human Systems

Every system has feasibility limits.

Beyond a certain threshold, no amount of optimization, enforcement, or incentive design can make a system function as intended.

These limits are not always technological or economic.
Many are human.

Inner order defines one such limit.

When systems assume a level of internal coherence that participants do not possess, the system becomes fragile.

It may work temporarily through control and compensation.
Over time, it accumulates overhead, friction, and failure modes.

This is why some systems look elegant on paper but collapse in practice.

They exceed the inner order capacity of their participants.

Adding rules does not fix this.
Adding surveillance does not fix this.
Adding incentives only postpones breakdown.

At scale, systems must remain within the feasible range of human internal coherence.

Inner order does not make any system possible.
But it determines which designs are realistic and which are structurally unstable.

Ignoring this boundary leads to recurring cycles of reform, escalation, and collapse.

Respecting it allows for simpler, more resilient designs.
